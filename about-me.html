                <p class="article-body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>
                    I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
                    any of it because there was too much
                    
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    Things were terrible, I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
                    a relationship.
                </p>

                <h3> How I turned things around</h3>
                <p class="article-body">
                    <strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>
                    I literally put 90% of my possession in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, around
                    I quit my job.
                    
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do.
                    And it worked. 
                </p>
                <h3> Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p class="article-body">
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>
                    and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site.
